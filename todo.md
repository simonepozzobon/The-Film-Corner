## Todo

- add edit on video-library
- make video library restricted to admin only
- delete unused video editor sessions to save space on storage.
- delete unused export after rendering on video editor (VideoEditorController)
- Use demuxer instead of concat protocol when rendering? (?)
- add loading to keep the user locked when rendering (pace.js)
- add library settings per app (so admin can assign video to one app and manage from a unique panel)
- add settings model for limiting using of resource per app
- add save function to video editor (_can be useful also for deleting sessions and unused rendering_)
- add note system to write notes on video editor.


## Progress
