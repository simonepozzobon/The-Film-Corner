                “The Film Corner Reloaded – A cultural approach” is a follow-up
                project stemming from “The Film Corner. Online and offline
                activities for film literacy” already financed in the frame of
                this call in 2016. The aim of this second edition of the
                project, “The Film Corner Reloaded – A cultural Approach”, is to
                design, develop amd test an innovative set of didactical
                resource: an online interactive user-centered platform for film
                education addressed to school students aged 11-18 and their
                teachers with the general purposes of increasing sensitivity and
                appreciation of film, increasing the film education average
                skills among EU students and fostering engagement towards film.

                In “The Film Corner. Online and offline activities for film
                literacy” 2 sections of the platform have already been
                developed; in “The Film Corner Reloaded – A cultural approach” a
                third section of the platform will be developed. The first two
                sections were dedicated to a critical approach to film language
                and to film as an art form and to a creative approach to film
                and to filmmaking; the new section of the platform will be
                dedicated to an interdisciplinary and cross-curricular approach
                to film education centered on the main topic of film and its
                relationships with other subjects, arts and topics. Through this
                new section of the platform the project aims to provide teachers
                with a prompt tool that support teachers in fulfilling the
                objectives of the curricular didactical activity through a set
                of didactical resources using film as a cross-cutting subject
                that can foster connections throughout the school curriculum.
            </ui-paragraph>
            <ui-paragraph :has-padding="false">
                The platform will be created around a selection of EU and non-EU
                films and audiovisual, both industry and heritage films, for
                which rights will be cleared in cooperation with rightholders.
                Moreover, in the occasion of the European Year of Cultural
                Heritage, The Film Corner platform will also present a catalogue
                of EU both classic and contemporary feature films that will be
                available for free on a vod section of the platform. LUX Prizes
                selection of the recent years will be also taken into account
                for the selection of the catalogue.
            </ui-paragraph>
            <ui-paragraph :has-padding="false">
                The new tool will be strongly integrated and connected with the
                sections of the platform that have already been developed,
                creating a connection among the three areas explored by the
                platform: the critical, creative and cultural/interdisciplinary
                ones, making an all-in-one interactive didactical tool that can
                help teachers building a coherent and exhaustive program of film
                education. The platform will also include a public networking
                space in which schools in the countries involved can connect
                each other, fostering interaction and viral online dissemination
                of the project.
            </ui-paragraph>
            <ui-paragraph :has-padding="false">
                The platform is totally available for free for school teachers

                2018 until november 2020. It consists of 16 tasks divided into 3
                work packages: platform development; testing; communication and
